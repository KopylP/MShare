      <h2>What is MShare?</h2>
      <p>MShare is a handy tool that helps you share music between Apple Music and Spotify.  Imagine you have a song you love on Apple Music, but your friend only uses Spotify.  MShare takes the link from Apple Music and finds the equivalent song on Spotify, generating a shareable link for them to enjoy!</p>
