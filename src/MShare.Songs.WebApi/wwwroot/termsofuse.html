    <h2>3. Use of Data</h2>

    <p>The data collected by MShare is used for the following purposes:</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>

    <p>MShare takes reasonable steps to protect the information you provide from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage method is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>The App may integrate with third-party services like Apple Music and Spotify. These services have their own privacy policies that govern their collection and use of data. We encourage you to review their policies for more information.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to Terms of Use</h2>

    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms on the App. You are advised to review these Terms periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the App after the revised Terms are posted signifies your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
